Victor's new novel *'Les Misérables'* was released to mixed reviews. His Republican friends could not understand why one might spend so much time endulging the poor, but a half century from now it will be described by quite a reasonably talented writer as being "one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world" and has been popularized through numerous adaptations for film, television and stage, including a musical.

An incident Hugo witnessed in 1829 involved three strangers and a police officer. One of the strangers was a man who had stolen a loaf of bread, similar to Jean Valjean. The officer was taking him to the coach. The thief also saw the mother and daughter playing with each other which would be an inspiration for Fantine and Cosette. Hugo imagined the life of the man in jail and the mother and daughter taken away from each other.

Valjean's character is loosely based on the life of the ex-convict Eugène François Vidocq. Vidocq became the head of an undercover police unit and later founded France's first private detective agency. He was also a businessman and was widely noted for his social engagement and philanthropy. Vidocq also inspired Hugo's "Claude Gueux" and Le Dernier jour d'un condamné (The Last Day of a Condemned Man).
